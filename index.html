    Hi! I'm Inho Park (he/him) from South Korea. Currently (As of August 2022) I'm a junior at the VCUarts Graphic
    Design department. I graduated my highschool in Fiji in 2017, and came to VCU in 2018. In 2019, I took gap years to
    join the South Korean military. I served in the <a href="https://www.2id.korea.army.mil/">2nd US-Korea Combined
      Infantry Division</a> as a translator and returned to VCU in 2021 to continue my study. I'm looking forward to
    learn handmade websites this fall!

  <h2>My Passion</h2>
  <p>
    Hmmm... What is my passion? This one was difficult was because my passions and interests always seem to change and
    be all over the place. Here are some of my passions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Sushi</h3>
      <p>I love sushi with passion. Although I wish I had all the money to fund this particular passion of mine, but I
        do like sushi a lot. I like how there are different sushi by region and season, and the sense of craftsmanship
        that goes into making sushi. It's very simple yet complicated food.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>UX/UI</h3>
      <p>What I like about UX/UI is that it's a field about designing for someone in mind. I research, interview, and
        empathize with the potential end users to really understand what they need. This gives a reason for and a value
        to my design. You know when you are cooking food for someone and you see them enjoying your food? It's something
        like that I like about UX/UI.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Books</h3>
      <p>When I ask my friends about their favorite books, most of the times they tell me some form of novel books.
        Science fiction, Mystery, Crime, Romance, etc. However, I.. have somewhat unusual(?) preference. I like reading
        books about certain field of study. For example, I really liked a textbook I had to read for my mass
        communications class. Yes - The exam and memorization part was defintely not my favorite. But I do enjoy the
        learning part.</p>
