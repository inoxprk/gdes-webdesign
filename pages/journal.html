<h2 >Week 5: “Hello World!”</h2>
<p>
  Taeyoon encourages us to take a step back from computers which we became too familiar with. And day after day, the gap between computers and us grows bigger and bigger making it hard and even reluctant to understand what computers are and how it works. On the other hand, you might ask “why do we need to understand it in the first place?” Well, first thing is that it’s not about understanding the science behind computers, software, and hardware. What I thought Taeyoon’s Handmade Computers communicated is understanding how computers work and from there understanding how we, humans work. Because after all, we built the computers! Also, it’s not only computers where we can find the roots of how we think and function. It can be observed from paintings, architecture, cities, and more.

<h2 >Week 2: "Times and Temporalities of Web"</h2>
<p>
  The text felt like a reminiscence of early days of webs. There’s the value of the “handmade webs” that’s been forgotten after the webs started having more than what’s being displayed on the screen and the front-end. After the appearance of large social media platforms, the maintenance, interaction, logistics behind the web gained more importance. Building your own webpage became a thing of past that you don’t need to invest time and energy on.
</p>
<p>
  However, the value of the “handmade webs” still alive as much as the webs built a decade ago still works today. Although some webpages no longer work due to changes to technology (end of the internet explorer is one), handmade webs serve as your personal archive. Furthermore, your web can be an archive that still lives today unlike historical archives in museum which lives in the past. 
</p>
<p>
  Then, there’s the value of craftsmanship - The time and energy you invest to making the web, managing the codes with your own hand makes your website more special to you. That is something Facebook nor Instagram can’t provide you. It’s like decorating your room. You paint your walls, it may fail, but you get sense of intimacy to your room. 
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, handmade webs feel like romanticism of early 2000s’ webs. It’s like seeing a potter who keeps crafting using traditional methods instead of using technologies. However, as for me who also occasionally enjoys a slower path over efficiency (such as cooking complicated dish instead of eating out), I would still choose to write a web line by line even if that’s simply romanticism of handmade crafts.

<h2>Week 1: "My Website is a Shifting House" & "A Rant of Technology"</h2>
<p>
  I thought about what technology is, and the purpose of websites again. As Gen Z, we were pretty much born with technology and websites. They are as common as air and didn’t feel like anything new to me. For this reason, I didn’t really think about what the value of technology and websites are to me as a designer.
</p>
<p>
  I thought I should start with not seeing technology as something very complex, something reserved for engineers and the “tech experts”. Technology is not limited to robotics, nuclear engineering, chemical engineering, etc - They can be as simple as a match for lighting a fire. With this approach, I thought about how I be more open to using technology and utilize them in my design practice.
</p>
<p>
  Then there was thinking about the purpose of websites. Just as the reading said, I mostly saw websites in terms of functionality in the eyes of similar to what big corporates would have. I nearly forgot about how websites could also be an experimental space, not just a commercial space like Instagram, Google, Amazon, and more. It reminded me when I used p5.js in my first class for graphic design. It was a very simple javascript library, and the experience was nothing like other times when I used web browsers for. It was closer to playing in a sandbox.
